***After completing this step, exit SSH and log in again. ***

## 3. Start installation and deployment

- 1. Log in to SSH using the tool we downloaded earlier (some tools will still pop up a password for the first connection, remember to click X and then add the password)
Use serv00 to send you information via email (username and panel below should be changed to the corresponding information received in your email).
```
ssh <username>@<panel>.serv00.com
```

- 2. After entering the panel, copy the following code to install it with one click
```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amclubs/am-serv00-vmess/main/install_serv00_vmess.sh)
```

- 3. Keep alive command (sometimes after the hen restarts, all processes and scheduled tasks will be deleted, so you need to manually re-execute the following keep alive command to make the scheduled task effective. Don't ask why, because it is a free sequela)
```
(crontab -l; echo "*/12 * * * * pgrep -x "web" > /dev/null || nohup /home/${USER}/.vmess/web run -c /home/${USER}/.vmess/config.json >/dev/null 2>&1 &") | crontab -
```
### The tunnel keepalive command is as follows
- Default tunnel keepalive command, <your panel open port> needs to modify your port
```
(crontab -l; echo "*/12 * * * * pgrep -x "bot" > /dev/null || nohup /home/${USER}/.vmess/bot tunnel --edge-ip-version auto --no-autoupdate --protocol http2 --logfile /home/${USER}/.vmess/boot.log --loglevel info --url http://localhost:<your panel open port> >/dev/null 2>&1 &") | crontab -
```
- Token fixed tunnel keepalive command, <ARGO_AUTH> needs to modify your token
```
(crontab -l; echo "*/12 * * * * pgrep -x "bot" > /dev/null || nohup /home/${USER}/.vmess/bot tunnel --edge-ip-version auto --no-autoupdate --protocol http2 run --token <ARGO_AUTH> >/dev/null 2>&1 &") | crontab -
```
- json fixed tunnel keepalive command
```
(crontab -l; echo "*/12 * * * * pgrep -x "bot" > /dev/null || nohup /home/${USER}/.vmess/bot tunnel --edge-ip-version auto --config tunnel.yml run >/dev/null 2>&1 &") | crontab -
```
- View keepalive crontab tasks
```
crontab -l
```
- After the above command is completed, the following information will be displayed, indicating that the keepalive setting is successful
```
*/12 * * * * pgrep -x "web" > /dev/null || nohup /home/${USER}/.vmess/web run -c /home/${USER}/.vmess/config.json >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

## 4. Test node
- 1. Copy the node information returned after successful installation to the subscription tool and you can use it

- 2. If you don‚Äôt remember the node configuration, you can check it through the following information
```
cat /home/${USER}/.vmess/list.txt
```
- 3. The node is accelerated by setting the domain name back to the source through Cloudflare‚Äôs CDN
- CF port type

HTTPÔºö80Ôºå8080Ôºå8880Ôºå2052Ôºå2082Ôºå2086Ôºå2095

HTTPSÔºö443Ôºå2053Ôºå2083Ôºå2087Ôºå2096Ôºå8443
